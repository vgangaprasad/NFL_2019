# NFL_2019_RegularSeason_Sunburst_chart
Interactive Sunburst Chart for NFL 2019 regular season games.

## Background

Recently I saw couple of Sunburst charts in the web and I found it very interesting because the chart displayed lot of information in one place and also it is ideal for  displaying the hierarchical data.

I play Fantasy Football and lost pretty bad this season by losing 8 games in a row, so I am planning to up my analytics game to get better for the next season :) Thought I will start with some tools to help me get better in next season. Started with the Sun Burst chart to get all the games played and the results in one chart.

Future plans are to:

- Create charts for comparing players for the last 3 years,  </li>
- How the trend is for each player from Game 1 to Game 16 for the last 3 years? </li>
- few more...
